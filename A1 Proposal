# ICT 171 Assignment 1 Proposal
The proposed project involves the creation of a professional and user-friendly website for Villanuevas Pool Table, a small, family-owned business specializing in the sale and maintenance of high-quality pool tables. The website will serve as a digital storefront, helping the business reach a wider audience, showcase its products, and provide essential information for potential customers. 
The website will feature a clean, responsive design to ensure accessibility across devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The homepage will include a welcoming message, a brief overview of the business history, and images of the pool tables available for sale. A product gallery will showcase the different models of pool tables, with detailed descriptions, specifications, and pricing. This will allow customers to browse the inventory online and make informed decisions before visiting the store or contacting the business.
To facilitate customer interaction, the website will include a contact page with a form for inquiries, as well as essential business information such as the store address, phone number, email, and operating hours. An About Us page will highlight the business story, emphasizing its commitment to quality craftsmanship, excellent customer service, and decades of experience in the industry.
The website is currently hosted on a scalable and secure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform. It is currently hosted on an AWS server. Apache will be used as the web server software, and a custom domain name (e.g., www.villanuevaspooltable.com) will be registered and mapped to the server IP address. Security measures will be implemented in the future to protect customer data and ensure a safe browsing experience.
This project will not only provide Villanuevas Pool Table with a professional online presence but also serve as a practical learning experience in web development, server deployment, and cloud computing. By creating a functional and visually appealing website, the business can attract new customers, increase sales, and strengthen its brand in the local community.
